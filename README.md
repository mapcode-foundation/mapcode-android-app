# Using Git and `.gitignore`

It's good practice to set up a personal global `.gitignore` file on your machine which filters a number of files
on your file systems that you do not wish to submit to the Git repository. You can set up your own global
`~/.gitignore` file by executing:
`git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`

The local `.gitignore` file in the Git repository itself to reflect those file only that are produced by executing
regular compile, build or release commands, such as:
`target/ out/`

Tip: Use [[gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io)] to generate or update the `.gitignore` file.
